    <h1 align="center">Weclome to Entri</h1>
    <p style="color:cadetblue;font-size: large;">I decided to study for PSC in June 2021 when I received the confirmation message for the Secretariat Assistant Examination. Since joining, I have had a great learning experience in Entri. With the systematic syllabus scheduling in Gold Batch, I was able to study the topics on time. Also, the different tests they conducted helped me assess my study level, understand the weak areas, and improve those areas. I have already studied through Entri and made it to more than twenty lists.</p>
